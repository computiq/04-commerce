## implement the following API endpoints

* receives the item id and increase the quantity accordingly
* this endpoint is extremely similar to the reduce-quantity endpoint

```http request
/api/orders/item/{id}/increase-quantity
```


* create a create-order endpoint
* this endpoint should satisfy the following
  * create a new order
  * set ref_code to a randomly generated 6 alphanumeric value
  * take all current items (ordered=False) and add them to the recently created order
  * set added items (ordered field) to be True

```http request
/api/orders/create
```

* finish the addresses CRUD operations

```http request
/api/addresses
```

* create the checkout endpoint
  * you should be able to add an optional note
  * you should be able to add an address to the order
  * set (ordered field) to True, thus the order becomes sealed
  * change order status accordingly

```http request
/api/orders/checkout
```

## Bonus - (Rabab-Challenge ðŸ˜ˆ)

* the above API endpoints should satisfy the following
  * adding items to the cart are separate from the previous order items
  * check if you have an active order, then the create-order endpoint will check for the matching items (i.e. if you have items in your active order that matches the items in the cart) and instead of adding them to the order, just merge them (add the quantities) 
  * you can only have one **active** order
